# Piping

### Implemented the ability to connect an image to the PainterNode input, thereby creating piping in image.

#### There are options to configure piping (button Settings):

- Add as background
- Add as image
  - Size adjustment
  - Send to back canvas

### There are also options:

- Change size (change the canvas size in accordance with piping in image at the input)
- Update image (not update the images of the node with piping in image (**Note:** you must enable this option so that the mask does not change))
